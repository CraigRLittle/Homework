# CRAIG LITTLE
## I joined the Army Infantry directly after graduating high school. I spent 4 years in a future combat systems testing unit in El Paso, TX, then re-enlisted to deploy with the 101st Airborne Division to Afghanistan. After the Army, I began work in logistics, learning to operate lifts and move trailers in the shipping yards. I'm currently an export agent for international shipping.
