# CRAIG LITTLE
## I joined the Army Infantry directly after graduating high school. Spent 4 years in a future combat systems testing unit in El Paso Tx then re-enlisted to deploy with the 101st Airborne Div to Afghanistan. After the Army I began work in logistics learing to operate lifts and move trailers in the shipping yards. I'm currently an Export Agent for international shipping.
